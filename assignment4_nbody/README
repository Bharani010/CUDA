You may only modify the gpu.cu file and leave other files alone.


The starter code already build and run correctly, but it implements a
naive O(n^2) n-body algorithm.  Your job is to

1) reduce algorithmic time complexity from quadratic to linear;
2) implement the linear time algorithm in CUDA and optimize its performance

Your code should be tested with #particles in the range of 50,000 - 1,000,000.
